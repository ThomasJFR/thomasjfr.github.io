			<h5 class="h5 modal-title">Background & Objective</h5>
			<p>
			In their final year at UBC, engineering students pariticpate in a Capstone project, a project which takes place with a real
			company and intends to produce a real product or prototype. The project is meant to engage students in the entire engineering
			design process, from stakeholder consulation to requirements generation, concept generation to prototyping, and analysis to validation.
			While teams generally form and choose projects in September, my team formed the April prior, and reached out to a client during the summer.
			Our client tasked us with developing a pressure sensor for use short-term use aboard a satellite or similar spacecraft. 
			</p>
			<br/>
			<img width="100%" src="assets/images/capstone-poster.png" alt="Capstone Project Poster">
			<br/>
			<p>
			The project was intended to address a market gap emerging alongside a revolution in satellite technology. Over the last decade or so,
			satellites have become much easier to launch, which has given rise to "small-satellites": small, short-mission satellites that can be cheaply
			produced, launched and iterated upon. For such projects, there is a lack of sensor options. Traditional space-rated sensors generally have 
			long lead times, high costs, and feature more robustness and mass than is necessary for shorter-term missions. Automotive pressure sensors 
			are cheaper and more compact - desirable qualities for small-satellite applications - but lack the necessary features for reliable sustained 
			operation in harsh space environments. The purpose of this project was to design a sensor to bridge the gap between these two mature
			technologies to supply the emerging small-satellite market.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<h5 class="h5 modal-title">Development</h5>
			<p>
			The project spanned the entire design process, and as such, as I had a multitude of roles throughout the project. I will detail some
			of the most meaningful and challenging experiences.
			</p>
			<br/>

			<p>
			<i> Vibration Analysis </i><br/>
			A standard requirement of space-rated sensors is the ability to withstand the vibration environment they will be exposed to during launch.
			These vibration environments are quite extreme, and special care must be taken to identify and resolve any potential vibration-induced failure 
			modes. I took responsibility for performing the random vibration analysis for the project.
			<br/><br/>
			I began by familiarizing myself with relevant theory for vibration analysis, such as interpreting Power Spectral Densities plots and using
			Laplace transforms to compute stress responses in simple structures. Once I had familiarized myself with the theory, I created a MATLAB
			script to calculate the vibration response of a simplified version of the sensor, iteratively adding complexity as I was able.
			<br/><br/>
			Once I had reached the peak complexity that could be analyzed by manual calculations, I moved on to random vibration simulation.
			Using SOLIDWORKS, I first recreated the simplified sensor and performed a simulation, whose inputs matched those of the MATLAB script.
			After corroborating results and determining I was performing the simulations correctly, I performed the simulation on the detailed
			model of the sensor. Using the results of this analysis, I was able to determine the parameters most influencing the vibration response
			of the sensor, and identified possible failure paths and modes to be resolved.
			</p>
			<br/>

			<br/>

			<p>
			<i> Testbench Design </i><br/>
			One of the key requirements for the second was thermal and baric compensation, for which a second-order compensation scheme was needed.
			Without compensation, the sensor would produce highly inaccurate readings near its operational limits, which is visualized below.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<img width="100%" src="assets/images/capstone-response.png" alt="Output Response">
			<br/>
			<p>
			To enable testing, I constructed a testbench which used a LabJack to collect data. I soldered thermocouple and pressure sensor connections
			onto perfboards, and connected them to the LabJack. I also added strain reliefs and other mechanical features to the testbench, which prevented 
			the lead-ends of the connections from being damaged. Once the testbench was constructed, we connected it to various points along a manifold and 
			collected data at different temperature and pressure points; this data was used to produce a second-order fit for the compensator to use.

			Ultimately, the second-order compensation scheme was mostly succesful, bringing measurement error within project requirements. This could not
			be validated at lower temperatures, due to formation of ice and a lack of time to resolve this issue.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<img width="100%" src="assets/images/capstone-envelope.png" alt="Output Error Envelope">
			<br/>
			
			<p>
			<i> Harness Design </i><br/>
			Several pressure transducers were tested throughout the course of this project. One such transducer measured just 9mm in diameter, and required
			a custom harness to interface with the testbech. I constructed this harness using a set of crimps held in place by a 3D-printed frame. This
			required carefully designing features on the frame, since the 3D printer was limited in its capacity to produce fine details, and the frame was
			quite small and weak due to size constraints. The result was a "snowflake-like" frame, which had radial insertion lines and ridges to hold the 
			crimps in place once inserted.
			<br/><br/>
			Finally, wires were soldered to the crimps, and the construction was held together by heat shrink. The harness was succesfully able to interface
			the sensor with the testbench, allowing for smooth data aquisition to take place.
			</p>
			<br/>
			
			<h5 class="h5 modal-title">Achievement</h5>
			<p>
			Ultimately, the project was highly succesful. Thanks to our combined strong presentation, details-focused design, and effective documentation,
			our team was awarded the Capstone Project Award among our cohort. I also received a 95% score in the class.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<img width="100%" src="assets/images/capstone-team.jpg" alt="Capstone Team Picture">
			<br/>
			<p>
			I learned a great deal of practical and technical skills throughout the project. I learned a great deal about random vibrations, and how
			to use SOLIDWORKS and hand calculations to analyze them for failure modes. I learned about test bench design and data analysis techniques.
			I also learned about mechanical design principles which have helped me become a more well-rounded engineer.

			At UBC, I took a fourth-year engineering economics (MECH 431) course. Throughout this course, we routinely
			performed economic analyses, and the recommended software for doing so was generally Excel. Quite quickly,
			my classmates and I discovered that Excel, while effective for listing transactions, was cumbersome for
			performing complex economic analyses, often requiring changes to be manually reflected across several sheets.
			<br/>
			The objective of this project was to develop a Python library which would match the simplicity of Excel, while
			significantly simplifying the work required to perform complex analyses and visualizations.<br/>
			</p>
			<br/>
			<h5 class="h5 modal title">Development</h5>
			<p>
			Immediately upon beginning, I encountered the first major challenge of the project: How to structure the software package. 
			There were several possible ways to implement this package, so I began with high-level function design:
			I designed a variety of function stubs for the core functionality of the library, and showed it to classmates to
			receive feedback on which was the most intuitive. After selecting my favorite design, I created a UML diagram outlining
			the design in greater detail. This allowed me to design a class hierarchy.
			</p>
			<br/>

			<br/>
			<p>
			After having determined the design for the package, I began implementing the software. The base Project and abstract Cashflow objects
			were first, as these preceded the rest of the project's functions. I created a Git repository to track my changes, and 
			hosted the repository on Github. Once I had implemented the abstract base Cashflow class, I easily created specific cashflow types, such as
			Present, Future, and Annuity cashflows. These could added to a project in a single line of code, with the ability to forecast to any period
			. (Including infinity - more on this later!) I also used Pandas to generate dataframes to represent the cashflows with ease.
			<br/>
			A comparison between the Python code and a typical Excel cashflow spreadsheet reveals the simplicity of PyEEA compared to spreadsheets.
			</p>
			<br/>	
			<img width="100%" src="assets/images/pyeea-comparison.png" alt="Comparison of PyEEA and Excel">
			<br/>
			<p>
			Equally simple is visualizing the cashflows.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<img width="100%" src="assets/images/pyeea-comparison-2.png" alt="Comparison of PyEEA and Excel plots">
			<p>
			<br/>
			The real benefit of the project arises once analyses are considered. Typically in Excel, analysis methods such as simulations or
			sensitivity analyses require a new spreadsheet to be created, with either manual matching or complex linking to maintain parity
			between sheets. PyEEA offers a much simpler interface, declarative interface. For example, a sensitivity analysis, which valuates the
			project based on percent deviations in cashflow values, is performed as shown:
			</p>
			<br/>
			<img width="100%" src="assets/images/pyeea-sensitivity.png" alt="Sensitivity Analysis in PyEEA">
			<br/>
			<p>
			Other key features of the project were the implementation of taxes, depreciation-based tax shields, cashflows of higher complexity
			(e.g., Perpetuities, Geometric and Gradient Series, Learning Curve models) and ability to output Excel sheets from Project objects.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<h5 class="h5 modal title">Achievement</h5>
			<p>
			During the four-month course, I developed this Python package and used it to complete all my class assignments. At the same time, 
			I began my work term with Novo Nordisk. Thanks to good timing, I conducted my final project for the course in collaboration with 
			Novo Nordisk. For the project, I performed an economic and feasibility analysis on introducing advanced 3D printing technologies 
			into the company's sterile part production workflow. I considered a variety of 3D printing technologies, using PyEEA to compare the
			cost of each to baseline operational costs. Ultimately, I identified a potential use condition for one 3D printing technology that
			could reduce costs of procuring spare parts by up to 20%, which I presented to my department manager.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<h5 class="h5 modal title">Improvements</h5>
			<p>
			I had initially intended to publish the project on PyPi, Python's package indexer. While I did make an initial push of PyEEA to the
			PyPi test environment (https://test.pypi.org/project/PyEEA/), I ultimately did not have the time to polish the library into a state
			I would consider worthy of production. If I had more time, and perhaps a business case, I would like the opportunity to dedicate more
			time to the development of PyEEA.

			<h5 class="h5 modal-title">Background & Objective</h5>
			<p>
			At UBC, I took a third-year machine design (MECH 325) course, where I learned how to select machine components based on
			operational parameters of machines. Throughout the course, I learned how to use selection manuals and textbooks, such as
			Parker's Hydraulic Cylinder catalogue, and Mott's and Shigley's Machine Design textbooks. For a final project, we were tasked
			with developing a machine using the principles we learned in the classroom.
			<br/><br/>
			My team and I got in contact with Pavillion Renewables, a Bahrain-based renewables firm, who sponsored us in designing a 
			sun-tracking solar panel, with the potential for scaling up to a panel network, for use in the desert environments of Bahrain.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<h5 class="h5 modal-title">Development</h5>
			<p>
			Hydraulic actuators were selected for actuation of the solar panels, which I was primarily responsible for designing. To do this,
			I referred to Parker's Hydraulics design guidelines which allowed me to select properly-rated cylinders for the job. Due to the 
			high potential wind loading that the panel would experience, in addition to the sheer weight of the panel, the cylinder would
			need to be able to support significant load. Based on the forces and (low) speed requirements for the solar panel, I selected a 
			PH 2HX Cylinder, which achieved a safety factor of four based on operational requirements.
			</p>
			<br/>
			  <img width="100%" src="./assets/images/solarpanel-forces.png" alt="Solar Panel Forces" loading="lazy">
			<br/>
			<p>
			In addition to the above, I also specified some additional features for the hydraulic cylinder to accomodate the desert environment,
			such as PTFE wiper bushings to prevent sand and grit from entering the hydrualic chamber.
			</p>
			<br/>
		 	<p>
			Once the hydraulic cylinder had been specified, I then designed the pump network, which was needed to achieve the client's vision of 
			a networked series of solar panels. Based on customer specification of ten solar panels, This allowed for a centralized system and 
			fewer machine components overall. This setup is visualized below.
			</p>
			<br/>
			  <img width="100%" src="./assets/images/solarpanel-network.png" alt="Solar Panel Network" loading="lazy">
			<br/>
			<p>
			I again referred to Parker Hyrdaulics guidelines to select the pump, motor, tank, piping and hosing necessary to create the network.
			The connection of these components is shown in the circuit below.

			<br/>
			<h5 class="h5 modal-title">Achievement</h5>
			<p>
			At the end of the year, the project was presented to the professor and classmates. It received positive reviews, with the professor
			suggesting that the project could be considered for a Capstone project (i.e undegraduate final project).
			</p>
			<br/>
			<h5 class="h5 modal-title">Improvements</h5>
			<p>
			While it was exciting to design this solar panel, the design was purely theoretical. Had we had more time, or perhaps chosen 
			to pursue this project as a capstone project, I would have liked to try building the mechanism, especially the integration and validation
			of hydraulic cylinders. Still, I believe my experience in this project has prepared me to specify and integrate hydraulic cylinders in
			a future project.

			<h5 class="h5 modal-title">Background & Objective</h5>
			<p>
			In 2020, some friends and I decided to form a team to participate in RookieHacks,
			a hackathon based around learning a new programming language or framework. The hackathon took place just a few months
			after the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic, and was part of the surge of online hackathons that took place in its wake,
			We saw the hackathon as a great opportunity to learn some new frameworks (we ended up learning ReactJS and MongoDB), and
			of course, we hoped for a chance to win one of the first-place prizes!
			<br/><br/>
			As always, the hackathon began with a brainstorming session. Our team considered a variety of web applications to build.
			Ultimately, noting that COVID-19 relief efforts were largely global in scale, we decided to develop an app to facilitate 
			support for COVID-19-related initiatives on a local scale. The app would achieve this by bringing awareness to projects
			in one's community.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<img width="100%" src="./assets/images/covidonate-mission.png" alt="Help fight COVID as a part of your community. Our web app enables you to connect and help covid fighting efforts in your community and other members who have been badly affected by COVID-19." loading="lazy"> 
			<br/>
			<h5 class="h5 modal-title">Development</h5>
			<p>
			I was primarily responsible for developing the front-end application using ReactJS. To do this, I created a declarative
			routing framework for navigating between windows, and developed the various navigable pages. This especially included
			the home page, where users could browse COVID-19-related projects, and the login page, which connected to our MongoDB database.
			<br/><br/>
			One major challenge for the project was how to distinguish the app from competitors. This was partially resolved by our focus
			on local projects and initiatives, but we felt that this was still not enough. To further distinguish the application, I implemented
			a project sorting system. The system allowed users to sort through COVID-19-related projects based on a variety of categories. These
			included: 
			<br/> - How close the project was to completion, both in absolute (dollar) and relative (percentage) terms;
			<br/> - The physical proximity of the initiative to one's location, as determined using reverse geocoding; 
			<br/> - Other common filters such as alphabetical sorting, sorting by newest/oldest project, etc.
			<br/>
			Using these filters and sorting methods would allow users to sort through the many COVID-19-related initiatives in their area
			with relative ease. Those wanting to "boost" projects near completion would be able to do so, while others who wanted to make
			donations to the nearest initiative would have the means of discovering them.

			<br/>
			<h5 class="h5 modal-title">Achievement</h5>
			<p>
			Ultimately, our team was awarded "1st Overall Beginner" among the 371 total particiapnts for our development and presentation of COVIDONATE. 
			The application was presented to all participants at the awards ceremony. We hosted the app for a year as a Heroku app. (The website has
			since been decomissioned, but can still be viewed on the RookieHacks website.
			<br/><br/>
			One of the first place prizes was a pair of Snap Spectacles, which I have used to record many POV videos of my travels, longboarding
			sessions, and more, which can be viewed on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@InstaKilla8" class="timeline-text" style="display:inline; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<h5 class="h5 modal-title">Improvements</h5>
			<p>
			Given the rapid turnaround time on the project (as is typical of hackathons) the functionality of the website was favored over aesthetics.
			There was very minimal styling done on the website, which I would address if given the chance to work on this website again.
			(I have, incidentally, spent much more time styling this website than that one!)
