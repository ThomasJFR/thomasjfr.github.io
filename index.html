			<h5 class="h5 modal-title">Background & Objective</h5>
			<p>
			In their final year at UBC, engineering students pariticpate in a Capstone project, a project which takes place with a real
			company and intends to produce a real product or prototype. The project is meant to engage students in the entire engineering
			design process, from stakeholder consulation to requirements generation, concept generation to prototyping, and analysis to validation.
			While teams generally form and choose projects in September, my team formed the April prior, and reached out to a client during the summer.
			Our client tasked us with developing a pressure sensor for use short-term use aboard a satellite or similar spacecraft. 
			</p>
			<br/>
			<img width="100%" src="assets/images/capstone-poster.png" alt="Capstone Project Poster">
			<br/>
			<p>
			The project was intended to address a market gap emerging alongside a revolution in satellite technology. Over the last decade or so,
			satellites have become much easier to launch, which has given rise to "small-satellites": small, short-mission satellites that can be cheaply
			produced, launched and iterated upon. For such projects, there is a lack of sensor options. Traditional space-rated sensors generally have 
			long lead times, high costs, and feature more robustness and mass than is necessary for shorter-term missions. Automotive pressure sensors 
			are cheaper and more compact - desirable qualities for small-satellite applications - but lack the necessary features for reliable sustained 
			operation in harsh space environments. The purpose of this project was to design a sensor to bridge the gap between these two mature
			technologies to supply the emerging small-satellite market.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<h5 class="h5 modal-title">Development and Challenges</h5>
			<p>
			The project spanned the entire design process, and as such, as I had a multitude of roles throughout the project. I will detail some
			of the most meaningful and challenging experiences.
			</p>
			<br/>

			<p>
			<i> Vibration Analysis </i><br/>
			A standard requirement of space-rated sensors is the ability to withstand the vibration environment they will be exposed to during launch.
			These vibration environments are quite extreme, and special care must be taken to identify and resolve any potential vibration-induced failure 
			modes. I took responsibility for performing the random vibration analysis for the project.
			<br/><br/>
			I began by familiarizing myself with relevant theory for vibration analysis, such as interpreting Power Spectral Densities plots and using
			Laplace transforms to compute stress responses in simple structures. Once I had familiarized myself with the theory, I created a MATLAB
			script to calculate the vibration response of a simplified version of the sensor, iteratively adding complexity as I was able.
			<br/><br/>
			Once I had reached the peak complexity that could be analyzed by manual calculations, I moved on to random vibration simulation.
			Using SOLIDWORKS, I first recreated the simplified sensor and performed a simulation, whose inputs matched those of the MATLAB script.
			After corroborating results and determining I was performing the simulations correctly, I performed the simulation on the detailed
			model of the sensor. Using the results of this analysis, I was able to determine the parameters most influencing the vibration response
			of the sensor, and identified possible failure paths and modes to be resolved.
			</p>
			<br/>

			<br/>

			<p>
			<i> Testbench Design </i><br/>
			One of the key requirements for the second was thermal and baric compensation, for which a second-order compensation scheme was needed.
			Without compensation, the sensor would produce highly inaccurate readings near its operational limits, which is visualized below.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<img width="100%" src="assets/images/capstone-response.png" alt="Output Response">
			<br/>
			<p>
			To enable testing, I constructed a testbench which used a LabJack to collect data. I soldered thermocouple and pressure sensor connections
			onto perfboards, and connected them to the LabJack. I also added strain reliefs and other mechanical features to the testbench, which prevented 
			the lead-ends of the connections from being damaged. Once the testbench was constructed, we connected it to various points along a manifold and 
			collected data at different temperature and pressure points; this data was used to produce a second-order fit for the compensator to use.

			Ultimately, the second-order compensation scheme was mostly succesful, bringing measurement error within project requirements. This could not
			be validated at lower temperatures, due to formation of ice and a lack of time to resolve this issue.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<img width="100%" src="assets/images/capstone-envelope.png" alt="Output Error Envelope">
			<br/>
			
			<p>
			<i> Harness Design </i><br/>
			Several pressure transducers were tested throughout the course of this project. One such transducer measured just 9mm in diameter, and required
			a custom harness to interface with the testbech. I constructed this harness using a set of crimps held in place by a 3D-printed frame. This
			required carefully designing features on the frame, since the 3D printer was limited in its capacity to produce fine details, and the frame was
			quite small and weak due to size constraints. The result was a "snowflake-like" frame, which had radial insertion lines and ridges to hold the 
			crimps in place once inserted.
			<br/><br/>
			Finally, wires were soldered to the crimps, and the construction was held together by heat shrink. The harness was succesfully able to interface
			the sensor with the testbench, allowing for smooth data aquisition to take place.
			</p>
			<br/>
			
			<h5 class="h5 modal-title">Achievement</h5>
			<p>
			Ultimately, the project was highly succesful. Thanks to our combined strong presentation, details-focused design, and effective documentation,
			our team was awarded the Capstone Project Award among our cohort. I also received a 95% score in the class.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<img width="100%" src="assets/images/capstone-team.png" alt="Capstone Team Picture">
			<br/>
			<p>
			I learned a great deal of practical and technical skills throughout the project. I learned a great deal about random vibrations, and how
			to use SOLIDWORKS and hand calculations to analyze them for failure modes. I learned about test bench design and data analysis techniques.
			I also learned about mechanical design principles which have helped me become a more well-rounded engineer.

			<h5 class="h5 modal-title">Background & Objective</h5>
			<p>
				In 2019, I worked for eight months at Thin Red Line Aerospace. One of the key projects I took part
				in was the development of an interplanetary probe platform, the "Altitude Control Balloon". 
				The probe was based on a novel elevation control mechanism, described in the company's patent of
				the technology (US10196123B2).
				<!--a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US10196123B2/en"-->
				<br/>
				<img width="100%" src="./assets/images/acb-patent.png" alt="Patent Drawing for the Probe" loading="lazy">
				<br/>
				I arrived at the company just a few weeks prior to the 2019 Interplanetary Probe Workshop, where
				the technology was to be demonstrated: in particular, the company intended to demonstrate a
				successful flight test. Developing the probe - both to enable the impending flight test, as well as
				to refine it afterwards - were primary tasks of mine.
				<br/><br/>
				In the following sections, I will describe some of the key challenges during the weeks preceding
				the flight test.
				<br/><br/>
				<img width="100%" src="./assets/images/acb-filling.png" alt="Filling the Ballon on the Flight Test Day" loading="lazy">
			</p>
			<br/>

			<h5 class="h5 modal title">Development and Challenges</h5>
			<p>
				Most of my work concerned the mechatronic systems aboard the probe, which were many and complex.
				Upon my arrival, I began by identifying the most critical subsystems of the probe, and mapped
				the relationship of these subsystems using a UML diagram. This allowed me to prioritize development
				of systems within the limited development period preceding the test flight.
				<br/>
				<br/>

				<i> Control Systems </i><br/>
				Perhaps the most fundamental task for this project was developing an appropriate control system.
				This task was highly nontrivial, in particular due to the novel control mechanism of the probe.
				As described in the patent document, a motor is driven to adjust the length of a tension cable.
				This tension cable runs through an envlope comprising a series of gastight ellipsoidal segments 
				filled with a lifting gas. Adjusting the length of the tension cable causes the probe's envelope 
				to compress or expand, depending on which way the motor runs, thus increasing or decreasing the 
				density of the lifting gas. As the density of the gas changes, so does the average density of the
				entire probe. Buoyancy dictates that the probe will drive itself to that altitude where its
				average density is equal to the ambient air density, i.e., the equilibrium altitude of the probe.
				This is the fundamental control principle of the probe.
				<br/><br/>
				Given the novelty of this control mechanism, I could find no corellary control systems on which to 
				base the ACB's. While an altitude could be achieved by driving the ACB to a certain internal
				pressure, there would be significant lag in achieving the desired altitude, as the buoyancy effect
				would diminish while approaching the altitude. Moreover, a knowledge of system characteristics,
				such as mass and gas density behaviour as a function of motor position, were vital to achieving
				optimal control.
				<br/><br/>
				I approached designing the control systems by first familiarizing myself with relevant control
				theory, mainly through online resources. Once I was confident in my understanding, I developed a
				control diagram outlining the control algorithm for the probe, and the way in which it interacted
				with an operator.
				<br/><br/>
				<img width="100%" src="./assets/images/acb-algorithm.png" alt="Flight Computer Algorithm Control Diagram" loading="lazy">
				<br/><br/>
				Tuning and testing of the control system represented another significant challenge. The size of
				the probe, in addition to its flight parameters (namely, the altitude range over which it could 
				operate), made it impractical to test indoors. To address this challenge, I developed a
				comprehensive simulation of the balloon, which allowed me to tune the control system prior to
				field testing. This paid off hugely: A viable control algorithm was developed in simulation, and
				adjusted during field testing, producing higher-value results during field testing. Moreover, flight
				data was recorded on-board the probe, allowing for the simulation to be further refined, thus
				allowing control systems to be more precisely tuned prior to testing.
			
				<br/><br/>
				<i> Communication Systems </i><br/>
				For the flight test to be considered successful, the probe would need to engage a series of
				altitudes and trajectories. This was achieved by sending radio commands to the probe from a 
				ground station. The ground station would also receive real-time flight data from the probe,
				allowing for the flight to be monitored. A LoRa radio was used to enable bidirectional 
				communication between the ground station and the probe. LoRa was selected due to its 
				ultra-long-range capabilities and ease of implementation..
				<br/><br/>
				<img width="100%" src="./assets/images/acb-cc.png" alt="Description of Communication and Control systems" loading="lazy">
				<br/><br/>
				One key challenge of the communication system involved feedback. Because of the lag in visible
				response from the probe (as observed from the ground), it was essential to know whether or not 
				commands were successfully received and acted upon. To achieve this, I extended the base LoRa 
				protocol to include acknowledgements, similar to common protocols such as TCP/IP. This enabled
				the ground station to indicate if commands had been received and resend commands otherwise.
				Overall, the implementation was highly useful during flight testing, where discerning whether or
				not the probe was executing a new command was practically impossible without feedback.
				
				<br/><br/>
				<i>Mechanical Testing</i><br/>
				In addition to the key flight test, I conducted a variety of other tests to validate various aspects
				of the probe. This included pressurizing a representative prototype up to its maximum expected
				operating pressure (MEOP), testing the mechanical winch which powered altitude control, and
				evaluating the reliability of various manufacturing processes which were used to construct the 
				probe.
			</p>
			<br/>

			<h5 class="h5 modal title">Achievements</h5>
			<p>
				Powered by the control and communication systems I developed, the probe carried out a
				successful test flight, demonstrating user controllability and impressive flight characteristics.
				The results of the test, as well as the technology more broadly, were presented at IPPW 2019,
				where they were very well-received.

				<img width="100%" src="./assets/images/acb-interface.png" alt="User Interface During Flight Test" loading="lazy">
				<br/><br/>
				This flight test represents an extremely significant milestone in my engineering career. It was the
				first time I was responsible for a major project deliverable that could have serious ramifications
				on future prospects for the company. I keenly remember the day of the test flight being
				simultaneously one of the most exciting and stressful days of my life. The success of the test
				bolstered my confidence as an engineer and informed some of the electives I took in the final years
				of my university career. I continue to ruminate on the project to this day, thinking of ways the
				design could be improved.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<h5 class="h5 modal title">Improvements</h5>
			<p>
				When I took on this project, I was still relatively inexperienced as an engineer. Significantly,
				I lacked a substantial knowledge of modern control theory that would have been appropriately
				applied to the control problem at hand. While I was able to develop a highly-functional control
				system, I now have a much stronger understanding of control theory, and would apply an alternative
				control algorithm to solve the control problem.

			<br/>
			<h5 class="h5 modal-title">Background & Objective</h5>
			<p>
			At UBC, I took a fourth-year engineering economics (MECH 431) course. Throughout this course, we routinely
			performed economic analyses, and the recommended software for doing so was generally Excel. Quite quickly,
			my classmates and I discovered that Excel, while effective for listing transactions, was cumbersome for
			performing complex economic analyses, often requiring changes to be manually reflected across several sheets.
			<br/>
			The objective of this project was to develop a Python library which would match the simplicity of Excel, while
			significantly simplifying the work required to perform complex analyses and visualizations.<br/>
			</p>
			<br/>
			<h5 class="h5 modal title">Development and Challenges</h5>
			<p>
			Immediately upon beginning, I encountered the first major challenge of the project: How to structure the software package. 
			There were several possible ways to implement this package, so I began with high-level function design:
			I designed a variety of function stubs for the core functionality of the library, and showed it to classmates to
			receive feedback on which was the most intuitive. After selecting my favorite design, I created a UML diagram outlining
			the design in greater detail. This allowed me to design a class hierarchy.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<img width="100%" src="assets/images/pyeea-uml.svg" alt="UML Diagam of PyEEA">
			<br/>
			<p>
			After having determined the design for the package, I began implementing the software. The base Project and abstract Cashflow objects
			were first, as these preceded the rest of the project's functions. I created a Git repository to track my changes, and 
			hosted the repository on Github. Once I had implemented the abstract base Cashflow class, I easily created specific cashflow types, such as
			Present, Future, and Annuity cashflows. These could added to a project in a single line of code, with the ability to forecast to any period
			. (Including infinity - more on this later!) I also used Pandas to generate dataframes to represent the cashflows with ease.
			<br/>
			A comparison between the Python code and a typical Excel cashflow spreadsheet reveals the simplicity of PyEEA compared to spreadsheets.
			</p>
			<br/>	
			<img width="100%" src="assets/images/pyeea-comparison.png" alt="Comparison of PyEEA and Excel">
			<br/>
			<p>
			Equally simple is visualizing the cashflows.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<img width="100%" src="assets/images/pyeea-comparison-2.png" alt="Comparison of PyEEA and Excel plots">
			<p>
			<br/>
			The real benefit of the project arises once analyses are considered. Typically in Excel, analysis methods such as simulations or
			sensitivity analyses require a new spreadsheet to be created, with either manual matching or complex linking to maintain parity
			between sheets. PyEEA offers a much simpler interface, declarative interface. For example, a sensitivity analysis, which valuates the
			project based on percent deviations in cashflow values, is performed as shown:
			</p>
			<br/>
			<img width="100%" src="assets/images/pyeea-sensitivity.png" alt="Sensitivity Analysis in PyEEA">
			<br/>
			<p>
			Other key features of the project were the implementation of taxes, depreciation-based tax shields, cashflows of higher complexity
			(e.g., Perpetuities, Geometric and Gradient Series, Learning Curve models) and ability to output Excel sheets from Project objects.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<h5 class="h5 modal title">Achievement</h5>
			<p>
			During the four-month course, I developed this Python package and used it to complete all my class assignments. At the same time, 
			I began my work term with Novo Nordisk. Thanks to good timing, I conducted my final project for the course in collaboration with 
			Novo Nordisk. For the project, I performed an economic and feasibility analysis on introducing advanced 3D printing technologies 
			into the company's sterile part production workflow. I considered a variety of 3D printing technologies, using PyEEA to compare the
			cost of each to baseline operational costs. Ultimately, I identified a potential use condition for one 3D printing technology that
			could reduce costs of procuring spare parts by up to 20%, which I presented to my department manager.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<h5 class="h5 modal title">Improvements</h5>
			<p>
			I had initially intended to publish the project on PyPi, Python's package indexer. While I did make an initial push of PyEEA to the
			PyPi test environment (https://test.pypi.org/project/PyEEA/), I ultimately did not have the time to polish the library into a state
			I would consider worthy of production. If I had more time, and perhaps a business case, I would like the opportunity to dedicate more
			time to the development of PyEEA.

			<h5 class="h5 modal-title">Background & Objective</h5>
			<p>
			At UBC, I took a third-year machine design (MECH 325) course, where I learned how to select machine components based on
			operational parameters of machines. Throughout the course, I learned how to use selection manuals and textbooks, such as
			Parker's Hydraulic Cylinder catalogue, and Mott's and Shigley's Machine Design textbooks. For a final project, we were tasked
			with developing a machine using the principles we learned in the classroom.
			<br/><br/>
			My team and I got in contact with Pavillion Renewables, a Bahrain-based renewables firm, who sponsored us in designing a 
			sun-tracking solar panel, with the potential for scaling up to a panel network, for use in the desert environments of Bahrain.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<h5 class="h5 modal-title">Development and Challenges</h5>
			<p>
			Hydraulic actuators were selected for actuation of the solar panels, which I was primarily responsible for designing. To do this,
			I referred to Parker's Hydraulics design guidelines which allowed me to select properly-rated cylinders for the job. Due to the 
			high potential wind loading that the panel would experience, in addition to the sheer weight of the panel, the cylinder would
			need to be able to support significant load. Based on the forces and (low) speed requirements for the solar panel, I selected a 
			PH 2HX Cylinder, which achieved a safety factor of four based on operational requirements.
			</p>
			<br/>
			  <img width="100%" src="./assets/images/solarpanel-forces.png" alt="Solar Panel Forces" loading="lazy">
			<br/>
			<p>
			In addition to the above, I also specified some additional features for the hydraulic cylinder to accomodate the desert environment,
			such as PTFE wiper bushings to prevent sand and grit from entering the hydrualic chamber.
			</p>
			<br/>
		 	<p>
			Once the hydraulic cylinder had been specified, I then designed the pump network, which was needed to achieve the client's vision of 
			a networked series of solar panels. Based on customer specification of ten solar panels, This allowed for a centralized system and 
			fewer machine components overall. This setup is visualized below.
			</p>
			<br/>
			  <img width="100%" src="./assets/images/solarpanel-network.png" alt="Solar Panel Network" loading="lazy">
			<br/>
			<p>
			I again referred to Parker Hyrdaulics guidelines to select the pump, motor, tank, piping and hosing necessary to create the network.
			The connection of these components is shown in the circuit below.
			</p>
			<br/>
			  <img width="100%" src="./assets/images/solarpanel-circuit.png" alt="Solar Panel Circuit" loading="lazy">
			<br/>
			<h5 class="h5 modal-title">Achievement</h5>
			<p>
			At the end of the year, the project was presented to the professor and classmates. It received positive reviews, with the professor
			suggesting that the project could be considered for a Capstone project (i.e undegraduate final project).
			</p>
			<br/>
			<h5 class="h5 modal-title">Improvements</h5>
			<p>
			While it was exciting to design this solar panel, the design was purely theoretical. Had we had more time, or perhaps chosen 
			to pursue this project as a capstone project, I would have liked to try building the mechanism, especially the integration and validation
			of hydraulic cylinders. Still, I believe my experience in this project has prepared me to specify and integrate hydraulic cylinders in
			a future project.

			<h5 class="h5 modal-title">Background & Objective</h5>
			<p>
			At UBC, I took a fourth-year industrial robotics course. The final project for the course involved
			implementing a control algorithm onto a real-world robot. Some friends and I formed a team,
			and decided to implement a pick-and-place algorithm to be implemented on a Da Vinci Surgical Robot.
			The algorithm would identify colored objects on a surface using the robot's endoscopic camera and
			actuate the two robotic arms to collect these items and place them into a designated bucket or
			drop zone.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<h5 class="h5 modal-title">Development and Challenges</h5>
			<p>
			This project presented several challenges. First was the time-limited scope of the project: We were
			given just a few weeks to complete this project, which featured hardware and software we were largely
			unfamiliar with. There was the additional challenge of availability: These robots are multi-million
			dollar machines (Two of the three robots in BC are located in this lab) and so any damage to the robot
			might prevent us from completing our objective in time. This was especially relevant since we our algorithm
			would need to use both robot arms simultaneously, which posed the threat of arm collision.
			<br/><br/>
			After identifying these risks, we began by designing the control algorithm for the robot.
			The algorithm would need to combine computer vision and pick-and-place steps. Given the tight time
			constraints for the project, we limited the scope to performing an open-loop pick-and-place, based 
			on a single image capture from the endoscope.
			<br/><br/>
			Two control layers were specified for the design. The first layer, known as the Patient-Side Manipulator
			(PSM) Controller, was responsible for driving the individual robot arms. This included requesting items
			and receptacles from higher control layers, and executing the actions safely. The control algorithm
			is visualized in the diagram below.
			</p>
			<br/>
	  		<img width="100%" src="./assets/images/dvrk-psmcontroller.png" alt="PSM Controller Diagram" loading="lazy">
			<br/>
			<p>
			The second control layer, known as the Pick-and-Place Controller, managed the PSM Controllers for each
			arm by implementing control measures such as collision avoidance algorithms. The algorithm is visualized
			in the diagram below.
			</p>
			<br/>
	  		<img width="100%" src="./assets/images/dvrk-ppcontroller.png" alt="P&P Controller Diagram" loading="lazy">
			<br/>
			<p>
			A Target Dispatcher is also implemented which allows the objects identified by the computer vision
			algorithm to be dispatched to the most logical PSM for pick-up. This was done by sorting items into
			a double-ended queue based on an effort function, as visualized below.
			</p>
			<br/>
	  		<img width="100%" src="./assets/images/dvrk-targetdispatcher.png" alt="Target Dispatcher Diagram" loading="lazy">
			<br/>
			<p>
			Trajectories were generated in task space which presented certain challenges. Of primary difficult was the
			fact that "optimal trajectories" were often not linear, and could result in the arm colliding with the
			table. To avoid this issue, trajectory executions were conducted at an offset height, and the arm "lowered"
			onto objects to pick them up. This also eliminated the possbility of objects being knocked about by the
			manipulators, which could cause the open-loop algorithm to fail.
			</p>
			<br/>
	  		<img width="100%" src="./assets/images/dvrk-zoffset.png" alt="Z-Offset Diagram" loading="lazy">
			<br/>
			<p>
			When it came to testing the algorithms, several measures were taken to avoid causing damage to the robot.
			Firstly, we began by using simulations to validate our control algorithms. This caused some other issues,
			however, as we discovered that the origin of each robot was different based on its initial conditions.
			To remedy this, we implemented a calibration routine, which allowed the robot to have a virtual origin
			that could be referenced while executing pick-and-place tasks.
			<br/><br/>
			Once we began physical tests, we reduced the robot speed to a fraction of its full potential. 
			This not only greatly reduced the possibility of damage from high-speed collisions, but allowed
			for a greater timeframe during which an emergency stop could be triggered. Once we were comfortable
			with the algorithm, we gradually increased speed again.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<h5 class="h5 modal-title">Achievement</h5>
			<p>
			Ultimately, our team was successful in implementing and validating the pick-and-place algorithm. The
			project was presented to the professor and class, and was well-received. I received a 92% score in 
			the course.

			<br/>
			<h5 class="h5 modal-title">Improvements</h5>
			<p>
			Though the project was a success, there were certain key limitations of the final product. Most notably,
			while the CV and Pick-and-Place algorithms were independently verified, some issues arose during final
			testing which prevented the endoscopic camera from being used, and thus eliminated the possibility of
			using CV. Thus, the final product has not validated the integration of CV with the Pick-and-Place algorithm.
			If we had more time to diagnose the endoscopic camera problems, I would have loved to perform the 
			full system test.
			<br/><br/>
			Another issue was trajectory generation, as detailed above. In a future implementation, I would attempt
			to implement a better trajectory generation scheme using the inverse kinematics of the robot (which are
			published) which would allow for linear trajectories, or even more complex trajectories which offer more
			sophisticated collision avoidance.

				In 2019, I worked for eight months at Thin Red Line Aerospace. One of the first projects I took 
				part in while there was developing a wheel to be used aboard probes being designed for ocean
				worlds (e.g., Europa, Enceladus) whose cold temperatures and variable icy surfaces represent 
				significant engineering challenges for traditional mobility solutions.
				<br/><br/>
				To address this, Thin Red Line applied its proprietary ultra-high pressure vessel (UHPV) technology
				to produce a wheel capable of navigating the complex conditions of Ocean Worlds. The design features
				a series of UHPVs along the annulus of the wheel, which provide structure to the wheel alongside

				The wheel features an array of Vectran tendon spokes, which are activated upon pressurization of
				the wheel segments. I was tasked with developing a method for preprocessing, manufacturing and 
				assembling these tendons. Preprocessing was necessary to achieving predictable behaviour of the 
				spokes, e.g., by eliminating undesirable qualities present within virgin fibers. This process 
				required some trial and error, and I used strategies such as OFAT to guide these efforts. Once I had 
				developed a working preprocessing strategy, I codified a manufacturing and assembly process for the 
				resultant fibers in a technical memorandum.
				<br/><br/>
				Soon afterwards, I fabricated a number of tendons, which were used in the assembly of a testable
				prototype.

				The prototype wheel above was sent to Purdue University for testing. These tests are described
				in the paper, "A Single Wheel Test Rig for Ocean World Rovers" by Lu et al, 2023. Overall,
				the prototype was a scale-model success, proving that such an Ocean World Wheel is feasible.

			<h5 class="h5 modal-title">Background & Objective</h5>
			<p>
			In 2020, some friends and I decided to form a team to participate in RookieHacks,
			a hackathon based around learn
			after the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic, and was part of the surge of online hackathons that took place in its wake,
			We saw the hackathon as a great opportunity to learn some new frameworks (we ended up learning ReactJS and MongoDB), and
			of course, we hoped for a chance to win one of the first-place prizes!
			<br/><br/>
			As always, the hackathon began with a brainstorming session. Our team considered a variety of web applications to build.
			Ultimately, noting that COVID-19 relief efforts were largely global in scale, we decided to develop an app to facilitate 
			support for COVID-19-related initiatives on a local scale. The app would achieve this by bringing awareness to projects
			in one's community.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<img width="100%" src="./assets/images/covidonate-mission.png" alt="Help fight COVID as a part of your community. Our web app enables you to connect and help covid fighting efforts in your community and other members who have been badly affected by COVID-19." loading="lazy"> 
			<br/>
			<h5 class="h5 modal-title">Development and Challenges</h5>
			<p>
			I was primarily responsible for developing the front-end application using ReactJS. To do this, I created a declarative
			routing framework for navigating between windows, and developed the various navigable pages. This especially included
			the home page, where users could browse COVID-19-related projects, and the login page, which connected to our MongoDB database.
			<br/><br/>
			One major challenge for the project was how to distinguish the app from competitors. This was partially resolved by our focus
			on local projects and initiatives, but we felt that this was still not enough. To further distinguish the application, I implemented
			a project sorting system. The system allowed users to sort through COVID-19-related projects based on a variety of categories. These
			included: 
			<br/> - How close the project was to completion, both in absolute (dollar) and relative (percentage) terms;
			<br/> - The physical proximity of the initiative to one's location, as determined using reverse geocoding; 
			<br/> - Other common filters such as alphabetical sorting, sorting by newest/oldest project, etc.
			<br/>
			Using these filters and sorting methods would allow users to sort through the many COVID-19-related initiatives in their area
			with relative ease. Those wanting to "boost" projects near completion would be able to do so, while others who wanted to make
			donations to the nearest initiative would have the means of discovering them.
			</p>

			<br/>
			<h5 class="h5 modal-title">Achievement</h5>
			<p>
			Ultimately, our team was awarded "1st Overall Beginner" among the 371 total particiapnts for our development and presentation of COVIDONATE. 
			The application was presented to all participants at the awards ceremony. We hosted the app for a year as a Heroku app. (The website has
			since been decomissioned, but can still be viewed on the RookieHacks website.
			<br/><br/>
			One of the first place prizes was a pair of Snap Spectacles, which I have used to record many POV videos of my travels, longboarding
			sessions, and more, which can be viewed on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@InstaKilla8" class="timeline-text" style="display:inline; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<h5 class="h5 modal-title">Improvements</h5>
			<p>
			Given the rapid turnaround time on the project (as is typical of hackathons) the functionality of the website was favored over aesthetics.
			There was very minimal styling done on the website, which I would address if given the chance to work on this website again.
			(I have, incidentally, spent much more time styling this website than that one!)

			<h5 class="h5 modal-title">Background & Objective</h5>
			<p>
				Dodgems was a quick game I developed while trying to familiarize myself with the PyGame library.
				I wanted to create a skill-testing game that would be fun to test, while allowing me to implement a
				bunch of features I was interested in.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<h5 class="h5 modal-title">Development and Challenges</h5>
			<p>
				The game is rather simple in nature, and (in my opinion) highly addictive. The user controls a
				sprite (MegaMan) by teleporting him to one side of the window. The position is determined by
				crosshairs, which move up and down the screen, while the player stays put. The player teleports by
				pressing the appropriate arrow key.
				<br/><br/>
				The game begins with a single enemy (Thwomp) moving across the screen, bouncing against the window
				borders. Every few seconds, another enemy spawns, moving in a new direction. Each thwomp moves in
				a random direction with a random speed. Once a thwomp collides with the player, the game ends.
				The longer the player survives, the more points he earns.

			<br/>
			<br/>	
			<h5 class="h5 modal-title">Achievement & Improvements</h5>
			<p>
				I was able to implement the game above, and had some friends playtest it. They thought it was
				quite fun - even if they did die pretty quickly. :-)
				<br/><br/>
				At present, the game still has many bugs. The enemies despawn, but their hitboxes do not, so
				there becomes an "invisible kill zone" for the subsequent games. While the added challenge
				may be appreciated by some, this becomes especially tricky when the player dies in the 
				top left corner, where they spawn. (They enter an infinite death loop!) Really, the only
				reliable way to play the game right now is to restart the client after death.
				<br/><br/>
				Nevertheless, I am quite pleased with the game. Though simple, my friends enjoyed playing it,
				as did I. If I were to return to the project, I would love to publish it to the Play Store as
				an app - I think it's a great game for mobile platforms!
